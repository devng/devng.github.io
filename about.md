Hello, 

my name is Nikolay and this blog is the home to some of my thoughts and ideas, primarily boring software developer stuff. It is intended to be a reminder for myself, because I tend to forget a lot.

Not sure why you'd want to know anything more about me, but here is the short story. After college, I started off as a developer in the world of finance, but eventually I found my way to a startup in Munich, Germany, where I still work to this day.

Just think of me as a 30something grumpy developer working with all kinds of languages, but primarily Java and interested in all kinds of software projects.

I suppose I've been in this game since about 2003 and I still have a large amount to learn.

I hope someone finds something useful in this blog.
