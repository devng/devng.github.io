Hello, my name is Nikolay and I am software developer at a start-up in Munich, Germany.  This blog is the home to some of my thoughts and ideas, mainly related to software development. It is intended to be a useful reference resource for **myself**, since I am in favor of useful reminders, and I like to store only recent or important information in my brain.

Not sure why you’d want to know anything more about me, but here is the short story. After I finished university, I started off as a programmer in the world of finance, but eventually I found my way to a start-up in Munich, Germany, where I still work to this day.

Just think of me as a grumpy developer in his 30s working with all kinds of programming languages, but primarily with Java and interested in all kinds of software projects.

I suppose I’ve been in this game since about 2003 and I still have a large amount to learn.

I hope you find something useful in this blog, too. 

Feel free to comment on my posts, I would gladly answer any question and I am always open for suggestions.

#### What does DevNG stands for, you might ask.

Well, some say it is _Next Generation Development_, and others that it is _Developer Nikolay Georgiev_... All we know is that the URL is [devng.com](http://devng.com).
