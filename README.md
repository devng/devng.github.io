# DevNG - Next Generation Development

This is the home to the sources for my [blog](http://devng.github.io). 

It is based on: 
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - a simple, blog-aware static site generator, and
* [pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) - a simple, beautiful Jekyll theme that's mobile first.

To run it locally use:
```
jekyll serve --watch --config=_config.yml,_local_config.yml
```
