My name is Nikolay and I work as a software developer at a start-up in Munich, Germany. I had the idea for a blog for a while, but I seems that I put the actual implementation off to another day for a long time. Today the time has come to make a change and now I present to you my first blog post :)

So what is this blog all about?
---------------------------------------

In short, it is about software development. Working at a start-up company as well as being an open source enthusiasts gives me the opportunity to work on some interesting problems and experiment with new technologies. In this blog I would like to share some of my experiences and insights from working with these technologies. 

Please note that most of the information posted in this blog you can probably find elsewhere on the Internet, but this blog is **primarily intended for myself** and I plan I to use it as a reference to some knowledge which is useful to me. However, I still hope you can find something helpful here as well. 

Feel free to comment on my posts, I would gladly answer any question and I am always open for suggestions.
